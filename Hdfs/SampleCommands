Facts about HDFS:
-----------------
In HDFS, the data is organized as blocks, blocks are stored in replicated fashion across data nodes.
In HDFS, the default block replication is 3 i.e., thre different data nodes.
HDFS behaves Linux like file system through its POSIX capabilities.
In HDFS, File system starts with root i.e., "/".
HDFS file system protocol is hdfs://
HDFS consider Linux users and groups.
In HDFS, every user has home directory like linux HOME i.e., /user/$USER.
In HDFS, directory is empty file and replication factor is not applicable.
In HDFS, every & directory has file permissions to restict the data access.

fs/dfs is the command to execute file system operations like directory creation, renaming files,
copying files, removing, displaying files, etc. It offers several command options, some of them are below

fs is associated with hadoop shell script whereas dfs is associated with hdfs shell script. Both have a bunch of command options.
Some of them are below:

ls : To list the files and directories
     Cmd> hadoop fs -ls /
     Descption: This command lists all the files & directories under the root directory of HDFS.

mkdir: To create directories in HDFS.
      Cmd> hadoop fs -mkdir /data
      Description: It creates a directory data under the root of HDFS.
      
put : To load the files from local file system to HDFS
      Cmd> hadoop fs -put stocks /data
      Description: Load the stocks file from local system to HDFS directory /data
      
get : To load the files from HDFS to local file system
      Cmd> hadoop fs -get /data/stocks groups
      Descrpiton: Load the stocks file from HDFS /data/stocks to local file system under specified path.
      
cat : Prints the data over STDOUT i.e., console.
      Cmd> hadoop fs -cat /data/stocks
      Description: It displays the content of stocks file in stdout
      
tail : Prints last 1KB of the file.
      Cmd> hadoop fs -tail /data/stocks
      Description: It displays the last 1KB content of stocks file
      
cp : Copies the file or directory from one HDFS path to another HDFS path.
      Cmd> hadoop fs -cp /data/stocks  /nyse/stocks
      Description: This copies stocks file from /data to /nyse directory with in HDFS.
      
mv : Rename file or directory in HDFS
     Cmd> hadoop fs -mv /data/groups /groups
     Description: This moves/rename the file stocks /data/stocks to /data/stocks.csv
     
rm : To delete file or directory in HDFS
     Cmd> hadoop fs -rm /nyse/stocks - to Delete file
     Cmd> hadoop fs -rm -R /nyse - to delete directory
There are many more command options to other file operations.
There is a big list of HDFS commands to perform admin operations.
