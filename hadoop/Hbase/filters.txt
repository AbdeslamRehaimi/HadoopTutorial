BinaryPrefixComparator

BinaryComparator

KeyValue Metadata
HBase stores data internally as KeyValue pairs, KeyValue Metadata Filters evaluate the existence of keys (i.e., ColumnFamily:Column qualifiers) for a row, as opposed to values the previous section.

FamilyFilter
FamilyFilter can be used to filter on the ColumnFamily. It is generally a better idea to select ColumnFamilies in the Scan than to do it with a Filter.

QualifierFilter
QualifierFilter can be used to filter based on Column (aka Qualifier) name.

ColumnPrefixFilter
ColumnPrefixFilter can be used to filter based on the lead portion of Column (aka Qualifier) names.

MultipleColumnPrefixFilter
MultipleColumnPrefixFilter behaves like ColumnPrefixFilter but allows specifying multiple prefixes.

ColumnRangeFilter
A ColumnRangeFilter allows efficient intra row scanning.
