Apache Zookeeper is an open source project from Apache Software Foundation
Apache Zookeepr is distributed coordination service which is used to build general purpose distributed applications.

In distributed systems, partial failures are common. In distibuted systems, many nodes communicate each other, some these 
operations may fail and sender doen't know the staus of the message. To guaranty the communication between nodes, we need 
very realiable coordination service.

ZooKeeper canâ€™t make partial failures go away, these are intrinsic to distributed systems. Zookeeper handles all these
partial failures and it connot hide them.
