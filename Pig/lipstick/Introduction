1.  Introduction Lipstick:

    Lipstick combines a graphical depiction of a Pig workflow with information about the job as it executes,
    giving developers insight that previously required a lot of sifting through logs (or a Pig expert) to piece together

2.  Installing and Running Lipstick:

    The following steps are required to install lipstick:
    
    Step1:  Download the source code from git repository
        
            cmd> git clone https://github.com/Netflix/Lipstick.git
    
    Step2:  Installing runtime dependencies
            Install graphviz --> rich set of graph drawing tools
    
            Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install graphviz
    
            Cent OS: yum install graphviz
    
    Running Lipstick Locally....
    -----------------------------
    Step3:  Start the server
            cmd> cd <cloned listick repo> i.e cd Lipstick
            cmd> ./gradlew debug -PwithHadoop
            
            cmd> cd quickstart/
            cmd> ../example1
            
    Running Lipstick on Hadoop Cluster....
    --------------------------------------
    Step4:  Install the MySQL database
    Step5:  cmd> cd lipstick
            cmd> ./gradlew
            This will create the lipstic-x.x.war file in build directory of the lipstick home
            
    Step6:  Install the apache tomcat to deploy lipstick war
    Step7:  Please increase the size of the war file to deploy in tomcat by modifying the webapps/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml to 100 MB (Default 
            allowed war size is 50 MB, but lipstick war more than 50 MB)
    Step8:  We will see the lipstick web interface on http://hadoop:8080/lipstick-1.0/
