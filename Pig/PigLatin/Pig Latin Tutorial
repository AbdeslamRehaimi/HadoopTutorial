Case Sensivity:
Pig Latin neither case sensitive nor case insensitive. It is both, some of the things are case sensitive and some of the
things are case insensitive.
Case Sensitive examples are: Functions, relations, Storage types, fields etc...
Case insensitive examples are: operators, keywords etc...

Casting:
Pig Latin supports two types of casting:
1. Implicit casting: done by compiler. This works within the same data types family like int to long.
2. Explicit casting: done by developer. This works across the data types like string to int, double to int etc..
example: (datatype) exapression/field
          (double) A/B Both A and B are type int;
