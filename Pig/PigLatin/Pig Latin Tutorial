Pig latin is a scripting like language offred by Pig Framework:

Pig Latin Building Blocks:

The following are building Blocks of Pig Latin:

1. Comments
2. Case Sensitivity / Case Insensitivity
3. Casting
4. Data Types
5. Storage Types
6. Relations, Schemas, Fields
7. Operators
8. Functions
9. Macros
10. Pig Latin Preprocessor
11. Pig Compiler


Comments:

Pig Latin supports two types of comments
1. Single line - SQL Style (--)
2. Multi line - Java Style (/*....*/)

Case Sensivity:
Pig Latin neither case sensitive nor case insensitive. It is both, some of the things are case sensitive and some of the
things are case insensitive.
Case Sensitive examples are: Functions, relations, Storage types, fields etc...
Case insensitive examples are: operators, keywords etc...

Casting:
Pig Latin supports two types of casting:
1. Implicit casting: done by compiler. This works within the same data types family like int to long.
2. Explicit casting: done by developer. This works across the data types like string to int, double to int etc..
example: (datatype) exapression/field
          (double) A/B Both A and B are type int;
          
Data Types:
Pig Latin has two types of data types:
1. Scalar Data Types
2. Complex Data Types

Scalar data Types: These are used to hold the scalar/atomic/primitive values. Some of the scalar data types are:
int, long, float, double, chararray, bytearray, boolean, datetime etc..

Complex data Types: These are used hold the multiple values of same or different type. We have three complex data types in Pig Latin
They are:
1. tuple
2. map
3. bag

Tuple: It is an ordered collection of fields. It is denoted by (). It may conatin scalar or complex data types as it's
field data types
Map: It is key-value pair association. It is denoted by [].
Bag: It is an unordered collection of tuples. It is also called a relation. It is denoted by {}. It uses both memeory and disk
to store it's data. Naturally bag is very big data type in terms of values.

Storage Types:
Pig Latin has seveal storage types, which are used to parse the content while reading and writing from/to File System(HDFS)
The following are some of the Storage Types:

Storage Type:                 Read/Load           Store/Write

AccumuloStorage               Yes                 Yes


Relations, Schemas, Fields:
Realtion: A relation is a bag. It is also a variable to reference the pig latin statements. In pig script, for all pig latin statements
before the opehand is called a relation name. Relations are must start with an alphabhet.
Schema: Pig imposes schema on File System data while reading (i.e Read on Schema). This schema imposistion happens two ways,
Those are:
1. Automatic - Pig Guessed Schema
2. Manual - Developer provided

Automatic: While loading the data from file system into pig, if developer ignores schema, pig automatically guess schema
for input data. This is schema conatins bytearray as data type for all the fields. All the field names are anonymous. These
fields can be accessed by using $0....$n notation i.e $o is column1, $1 is column2 and $n is columnn+1 etc...

Manual: While loading the data from file system into pig, developer provides schema. This provided schema can be used in the
following subsequent pig latin statements
